### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
.hero__img {
  width: 100%;
  min-height: 30vh;
  background-color: var(--color-accent);
  background-image: url('images/image-header-mobile.jpg');
  background-position: center;
  background-size: cover;
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
  background-blend-mode: multiply;
  border-radius: 8px 8px 0 0;
}
```

### Continued development

This was the first project I really focused on using the BEM class naming convention. I found that BEM is incredibly helpful in organizing the overall structure of the CSS design.
